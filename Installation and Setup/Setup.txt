b) Ensure that you have pip3 or equivalent installed on your system.
    - Note: This should be installed automatically when installing Python3

c) In your terminal run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - this installs all required dependencies and libraries to run the bot.



2. Create Bot from Discord Developers Portal:

    - Scroll down and under "Privileged Gateway Intents" switch on "Presence Intent" and "Server Members Intent".



3. MySQL:
a) Ensure that you have MySQL server running on your machine if you are planning to run it locally.
    - You can using the following link to install it.
        - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/

b) The DiscordMySql.sql script has everything that will be needed for the bot to run you can run it in the terminal using:
    - Linux or Mac:
        - mysql -u user -p < <path>/DiscordMySql.sql

    - Windows:
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/scripting/sqlcmd-run-transact-sql-script-files?view=sql-server-ver15

    - MySQL WorkBench:
        - if you have MySQL WorkBench installed you can run the script directly from the application.

    - Alternitively:
        - Log in to MySQL using "mysql -u user -p"
        - Copy and Paste command into the terminal



4. Environmental Variables:
a) In the src folder create a text document and name it ".env"
    - Note: This is a hidden file. You will need to show hidden files in your file explorer in order to access it

b) Paste the content of envCopy into .env

c) Replace <YOUR BOT TOKEN> with your Bot Token found in step 1b

d) Replace <DATABASE USERNAME> and <DATABASE PASSWORD> with the appropriate values.

e) If you plan to use MySQL that is not running on the same machine/server (eg. MySQL on a lamp server) as the bot you would need to SSH into the your MySQL database by setting the apporiate values.
    - Note: using_SSH must be set to True. (False by default)
    - Note: The database is relative meaning if the bot itself is running on the same server as MySQL, there would be no need to use SSH.
